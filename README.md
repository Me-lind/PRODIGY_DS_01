# PRODIGY_DS_01
# Population Data Analysis

This project involves reading and processing population data from a CSV file. The data contains population figures for various countries over several years [1960-2023] .

## Project Structure

- `population.csv`: The CSV file containing the population data.
- `Task1.ipynb`: The Python script used to read and analyze the data.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas library

You can install the required library using pip:
pip install pandas

## To run the script
python Task1.ipynb

## Script Details
The script performs the following tasks:

1.Reads the population.csv file using the pandas library.  
2.Skips the first 5 rows of the file as they contain metadata.  
3.Ignores lines with errors using the on_bad_lines parameter.  
4.Processes the data to extract meaningful insights. 

## Learning Outcomes
During this project, I learned:

1.How to handle CSV files using the pandas library.  
2.The concept of delimiters, which are characters that separate values in a file.  
3.How to skip lines in a CSV file that contain metadata or errors.  
## Acknowledgements
This project was completed as part of my ongoing learning in data analytics and data science.
